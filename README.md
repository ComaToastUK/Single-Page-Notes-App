## NOTE BUDDY

Note buddy is a single page notepad app written in pure Javascript.
For this project we wrote our own testing framework in Javascript in
order to have clear unit tests for our modules.

We took an object oriented design and development approach to this
project and using modular design patterns. We worked as an agile team
in a 5 day sprint to design and develop all aspects of this project.
